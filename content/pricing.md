      • Strategic Risk- Changes in the market and environment indicate that the
      strategy has become outdated and maybe the wrong one too in some cases. In
      my venture, a well and clear strategy has been planned. Due to changing
      theories and demands in this fast-paced world, a dynamic strategy may also
      turn to be wrong or old at some point of time. 


      • Technology Risk- In my venture, the complete overview of my application
      will be verified and cross checked on different platforms such as iOS and
      Android. The landscape and features of the application including the
      software’s used and try to use the best version of it.   


      • Market Risk- Market risk is also caused by the competitors. It can be
      reduced by comparing the investments made previously by others and analyse
      the graphics of it. The competition in the market is common but my venture
      has uniqueness which stands out among everyone in the market. Analysts
      will help to deduct the market risk beforehand and take related steps to
      reduce and eliminate it. In my venture analysts and investors compare the
      investment accounts and measurement will be taken for a specific period of
      time to get the expected returns. 


      • Financial Risk- My venture is a balanced and well planned one. There are
      limitations for everything. We take care of the customers and secure their
      payments and see that nothing can be scammed.  We started the venture on
      our own with our savings so there would be no problem in future such as
      loans and interests. Therefore, financial risk can be eliminated in my
      venture. 


      • Team Risk- There are no team risks in my venture as my team members are
      my family itself. We can trust each other very well and everyone is as
      dedicated as me towards the venture. There will be no betraying from any
      of the team members. Everyone works hard to make our venture successful in
      all the aspects. Hence there is no team risk for my venture.
