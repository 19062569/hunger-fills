    content: "• Strategic Risk- Changes in the market and environment indicate that the strategy has become outdated and maybe the wrong one too in some cases. In my venture, a well and clear strategy has been planned. Due to changing theories and demands in this fast-paced world, a dynamic strategy may also turn to be wrong or old at some point of time. \n\n• Technology Risk- In my venture, the complete overview of my application will be verified and cross checked on different platforms such as iOS and Android. The landscape and features of the application including the software’s used and try to use the best version of it.   \n\n• Market Risk- Market risk is also caused by the competitors. It can be reduced by comparing the investments made previously by others and analyse the graphics of it. The competition in the market is common but my venture has uniqueness which stands out among everyone in the market. Analysts will help to deduct the market risk beforehand and take related steps to reduce and eliminate it. In my venture analysts and investors compare the investment accounts and measurement will be taken for a specific period of time to get the expected returns. \r\n\n• Financial Risk- My venture is a balanced and well planned one. There are limitations for everything. We take care of the customers and secure their payments and see that nothing can be scammed. Decrease in currency rate also is one of the factors causing financial risk. Investment should be limited enough for the venture. High investments may sometime turn into huge loss too due to the share market. Hence to reduce this we fix the cost and don’t invest in huge sums. We started the venture on our own with our savings so there would be no problem in future such as loans and interests. Therefore, financial risk can be eliminated in my venture. \r\n\n• Team Risk- There are no team risks in my venture as my team members are my family itself. We can trust each other very well and everyone is as dedicated as me towards the venture. There will be no betraying from any of the team members. Everyone works hard to make our venture successful in all the aspects. Hence there is no team risk for my venture."
