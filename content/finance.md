      A balanced management of money should be maintained in every venture. For
      example, spending more money comes under high liquidity and going into
      debts for short period is low liquidity. 


      My venture is a balanced and well planned one. There are limitations for
      everything. We take care of the customers and secure their payments and
      see that nothing can be scammed. We started the venture on our own with
      our savings so there would be no problem in future such as loans and
      interests. Therefore, financial risk can be eliminated in my venture. 


      The following image roughly shows how much money is required to get my
      venture started today.
